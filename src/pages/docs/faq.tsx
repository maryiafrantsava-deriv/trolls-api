                <AccordionItem title="What is copy trading?">
                    <p>
                        Copy trading allows a client (the Copier) to automatically copy the trades of another client
                        (the Trader).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To allow others to copy your trades, set the ‘allow_copiers’ setting via the{" "}
                        <Link href="/playground/#set_settings">set settings</Link> call.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Trader may create a read-only API token and provide it to the Copier.</p>
                    <p>
                        Enabling ‘allow_copiers’ will also make the copytrading statistics call available. The
                        statistics call provides the information about an account. This is so that potential copiers
                        have an idea about the trader’s past performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To start copying, use the <Link href="/playground/#copy_start">copy start</Link> call. To stop
                        copying, use <Link href="/playground/#copy_stop">copy stop</Link>.
